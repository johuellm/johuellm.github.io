
All theses require you to write a proposal. The proposal should have the following outline:
1. Motivation
2. Background
3. Theory / Hypotheses
4. Methods

The template for the proposal and later the thesis should be:
- page margins (2.5)
- font: Times New Roman 
- font-size: 11pt
- double-spaced line spacing
- justified text-layout
- 12pt margin after a text paragraph
- numbered headers (1st-level: 14pt bold, 2nd-level 12pt bold, 3rd-level 11pt bold & italic)
- complete bibliography in APA7; all sections require citations
- (*tbd* upload a template file)

I supervise 2 types of methods:
1. Empirical (qualitative or quantitative), or
2. Design science research.

Empirical methods require you to collect either survey, experimental, or interview data.
It is recommended that you followed or at least read the lectures I give on empirical methods.
Design science methods require you to design, implement, and evaluate a software prototype.
Evaluation can be performed based on various means including survey, experiment, or focus groups.
In exceptional cases, I also supervise simulation-based papers.
I do not supervise pure literature reviews.

I supervise theses in the topical areas of:
- People Analytics,
- Information Technology and AI in Knowledge Work,
- Information Technology and AI in Agriculture, Farming, Manufacturing,
- Enterprise Communication and Collaboration Media, Virtual, Hybrid, Digital Work,
- eSports

Research questions typically...:
- address organizational or individual antecedents and consequences of using IT at work,
- examine user adoption, appropriation, satisfaction, or usage of IT at work,
- apply theories from organizational psychology, information systems, or management.



### Specifics for Internship Thesis

Internship thesis also require a strong scientific component.
The ECTS are awarded for the scientific report, not the practical work at the company.
The proposal will be signed by the student, the supervisor, and the company.
It serves as an agreement about the scope of the internship among the three parties.



### Specifics for Bachelor and Master Thesis

For a _bachelor thesis_, there are the following requirements:
- at least 300 minutes of empirical material for a qualitative study,
- a complete survey- or experimental-instrument and at least 30 respondants for a survey (to be discussed),
- design science evaluation requires a focus group with at least 5 respondants.

For a _master thesis_, there are the following requirements:
- at least 600 minutes of empirical material for a qualitative study,
- a complete survey- or experimental-instrument and a sufficient number of respondants according to the current state-of-the-art in sample size justification (see [Lakens 2022](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/8/1/33267/120491/Sample-Size-Justification)),
- two focus groups with at least 5 respondants each.
