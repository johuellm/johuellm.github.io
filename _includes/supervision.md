
These guidelines apply to IBA, BIT, TCS bachelor theses, BA, BIT master theses, and BIT internship theses.

I am happy to receive your email if you have any questions or want to inquire about a thesis topic.

<br>

**TOPICS**

I supervise 2 types of methods:
1. Empirical (qualitative or quantitative), or
2. Design science research.

Empirical methods require you to collect either survey, experimental, or interview data.
It is recommended that you followed or at least read the lectures I give on empirical methods.
Design science methods require you to design, implement, and evaluate a software prototype.
Evaluation can be performed using various means, including surveys, experiments, or focus groups.
In exceptional cases, I also supervise simulation-based papers.
I do not supervise pure literature reviews.

<br>

**I am currently looking for students who want to work on the following questions:**
- Supervised Representation Learning of Counter-Strike Tactics to Estimate Team Effectiveness (using Deep Graph Neural Networks)

<br>

Furthermore, I am open to you suggesting a topic in one of the following areas:
- Information Technology, Digital Innovation, and AI in Knowledge Work,
- Information Technology, Digital Innovation, and AI in Agriculture, Farming, Manufacturing,
- People Analytics,
- Enterprise Communication and Collaboration Media, Virtual, Hybrid, Digital Work,
- Data Science eSports.

Research questions typically...:
- address organizational or individual antecedents, consequences, or mechanisms of using IT at work,
- examine user adoption, appropriation, satisfaction, performance, or usage of IT at work,
- build novel IT artifacts based on simulations or machine learning,
- apply theories from organizational psychology, information systems, or management.

<br>

**PROCESS**

The process is:
1. Proposal / Research Topics
2. Full Thesis
3. Defense / Colloquium

The proposal should have the following outline:
1. Motivation
2. Background / Theory / Hypotheses
3. Methods
4. Expected Contribution
5. Schedule / Timeline

The proposal is a scientific document.
It should start from the state-of-the-art in science and justify which research question you want to address.
It requires citations in all sections (except contribution and timeline).

The template for the proposal and, later, the thesis should be:
- page margins (2.5)
- font: Times New Roman 
- font-size: 12pt
- double-spaced line spacing
- justified text-layout
- 12pt margin after a text paragraph
- numbered headers (1st-level: 14pt bold, 2nd-level 13pt bold, 3rd-level 12pt bold & italic)
- complete bibliography in APA7; all sections require citations
- the template includes more information
- [(download the template)](https://www.joschka-huellmann.net/download/2025-02-12-utwente-thesis-template.docx)

<br>

**TODO**

This website is still a work in progress, and I will add more as time passes. For example, I will add information on Mobility online, the necessary forms, and the defense.

### Specifics for Internship Thesis

Internship theses also require a strong scientific component.
The ECTS are awarded for the scientific report, not the practical work at the company.
The proposal will be signed by the student, the supervisor, and the company.
It serves as an agreement about the scope of the internship among the three parties.


<br>


### Specifics for Bachelor and Master Thesis

For a _bachelor thesis_, there are the following requirements:
- at least 300 minutes of empirical material for a qualitative study,
- a complete survey- or experimental-instrument and at least 30 respondents for a survey (*tbd*),
- design science evaluation requires a focus group with at least 5 respondents.

For a _master thesis_, there are the following requirements:
- at least 600 minutes of empirical material for a qualitative study,
- a complete survey or experimental instrument and a sufficient number of respondants according to the current state-of-the-art in sample size justification (see [Lakens 2022](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/8/1/33267/120491/Sample-Size-Justification)),
- design science evaluation requires two focus groups with at least 5 respondents each.
