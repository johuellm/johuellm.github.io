My name is Joschka Hüllmann and I am currently working for the <a href="https://www.smarter-work.de/">Smarter Work</a> competence center of the <a href="https://www.ercis.org/">ERCIS</a> at the <a href="https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de">Westfälische Wilhelms-University Münster</a>.

My research focuses on the analysis of digital traces in organisations and in broader society. One the one hand, I explore how organizations can seize the potential of digital traces in shaping the workplace of the future. On the other hand, I critically assess the wider implications of the algorithmification of work and life.

Besides writing academic articles, I am interested in maths, coding, popular science, edutainment, short stories, and the craft of writing. As such, I contribute to pop-journals, publish  articles on my blog, and push my commits to open-source projects.
