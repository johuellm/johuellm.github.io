<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
My name is Joschka Hüllmann and I am currently working for the <a href="https://www.smarter-work.de/">Smarter Work</a> competence center of the <a href="https://www.ercis.org/">ERCIS</a> at the <a href="https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de">Westfälische Wilhelms-University Münster</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on digital traces from communication and collaboration software in organisations. In particular, I explore patterns of collaboration that yield satisfying and productive work practices. I strive to promote the digital workplace and enable organisations to understand and seize the opportunities presented to them by the workplace of the future.

<p>
Besides writing academic articles, I am interested in maths, coding, popular science, edutainment, short stories, and the craft of writing. As such, I contribute to pop-journals, publish  articles on my blog, and push my commits to open-source projects.
