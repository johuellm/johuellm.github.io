          <br>Disclaimer:
          <br>
          <br><strong>Only the <a href="/de/imprint/">German imprint is legally binding</a>. The translation is just for convenience.</strong>
          <br>
          <br>Liability for contents
          <br>
          <br>The contents of our pages have been prepared with the greatest care. However, we cannot assume any liability for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with the general laws pursuant to &sect; 7.1 TMG. However, according to &sect;&sect; 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of any such infringements, we will remove this content immediately. Liability claims against the authors or persons responsible for this website for damages of a material or immaterial nature, which are based on possibly incorrect or incomplete data, are excluded, insofar as there is no gross negligence.
          <br>
          <br>Liability for links
          <br>
          <br>Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. If we become aware of any infringements of the law, we will remove such links immediately. The authors or persons responsible for this website are not liable for damages resulting from incorrect or incomplete content on the websites referred to by means of links.
          <br>
          <br>All legal disputes arising from this website are subject exclusively to German law.
          <br>
          <br>Data protection
          <br>
          <br>As a rule, it is possible to use our website without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our website, this is always done, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent. We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible. The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending advertising and information material not expressly requested is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of these pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, e.g. via spam mails.
          <br>
          <br>Copyright
          <br>
          <br>The texts and photos on the pages described by this imprint are protected by copyright. Copying these files and possibly changing them is therefore not permitted without the permission of the copyright holder (unless otherwise indicated, this is Dr. Joschka H&uuml;llmann). This does not affect the right to &quot;copy&quot; the files onto one&apos;s own computer in order to view the WWW pages on a browser.

          <br>Google Analytics
          <br>

Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
